**About Gary Moore**

Hello and welcome to Elite Human Performance. I'm Gary, a REPs certified level 3 CYQ personal trainer, VTCT sports massage therapist and British weightlifting level 1 coach with over 10 years experience working in the fitness industry.

I'm currently studying for a BSc (Hons) in sports science (strength&conditioning) to further my knowledge in the field of sports science and to gain professional accreditation as a fully qualified strength and conditioning coach.

I specialise in sports specific training, strength&conditioning and olympic lifting. I also provide one to one personal training services for all ages and abilities for those looking to improve their health and physique. As a personal trainer I have worked with a diverse group of people including amateur and semi professional athletes including those with physical and mental disabilities.
